# Math Problems
These math problems are random applications written based on weird questions or ideas with a mathematical basis. I'll try to keep this readme updated with each one that I write and its "why"

# Problems:
## The Hydra Game
see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prURA1i8Qj4

An attempt to solve the Hydra Game for Y=5 as described in the video.

**Problem:** The description of the Hydra Game that I'm working on solving is described as the Rapid Growth Example at time index 16:26. However they never describe how to properly detect the right-most-leaf. 

My code assumes that the right-most-leaf is any leaf on the node with the most leaves. However, this interpretation is wrong because the expected answer for Y=4 is 983,038 and my code with the above interpretation results in 327,677. The vague definition still blows up for Y=5, and my poor code can't find an answer.
