# Math Problems
These math problems are random applications written based on weird questions or ideas with a mathematical basis. I'll try to keep this readme updated with each one that I write and its "why"

# Problems:
## The Hydra Game
An attempt to solve the Hydra Game for Y=5 as described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prURA1i8Qj4
**Problem:** The description of the Hydra Game that I'm working on solving is described as the Rapid Growth Example at time index 16:26. However they never describe how to detect the right-most-leaf. My code assumes that the right-most-leaf is any leaf on the node with the most leaves. However, this interpretation is obviously wrong because the expected answer for Y=4 is 983,038. My code with my implementation give an answer of 327,677. However, the vague definition still blows up for Y=5 and my poor code can't find an answer.
